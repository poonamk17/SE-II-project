MoneySaver - Price Comparison Website

Outline :
This project aims at providing the best possible deal to the users for the required electronic product by comparing the product price and displaying the minimum price from various E-commerce websites such as Amazon, Flipkart and Croma (web-scraping the product details), which are leading and some of the best websites to shop. Additionally, once the user is satisfied by the deal, he / she can directly be navigated to the respective website to complete the process of buying the product. Thus, our website serves as a time - saving tool for frequent online buyers as they can compare the prices at one stop instead of searching for the same product on various websites.
