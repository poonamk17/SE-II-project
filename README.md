# MoneySaver  Price  Comparison website

## Outline  :
This  project  aims  at  providing  the  best  possible  deal  to  the  users  for  the  required  electronic  product  by  comparing  the  product  price  and  displaying  the  minimum  price  from  various  E-commerce  websites  such  as  Amazon,  Flipkart  and  Croma (web-scraping the product details),  which  are  leading  and  some  of  the  best  websites  to  shop.  Additionally,  once  the  user  is  satisfied  by  the  deal,  he / she  can  directly  be  navigated  to  the  respective  website  to  complete  the  process  of  buying  the   product.  Thus,  our  website  serves  as  a  time - saving  tool  for  frequent  online  buyers  as  they  can  compare  the  prices  at  one stop  instead  of  searching  for  the  same  product  on  various  websites.
